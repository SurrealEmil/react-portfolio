        "description": "As part of a small team consisting of just me and another intern, I helped design and develop a Pong-inspired game from the ground up. Built specifically for trade fairs and events, the game runs entirely in the web browser and lets players control paddles using Nintendo Joy-Cons via WebHID, transforming the classic game into something new and engaging. We handled everything from concept and design to development and testing, iterating regularly to fine-tune the game for live play."
